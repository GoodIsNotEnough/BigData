# How to write a paper

## Abstract

## Introduction
+ This separation of logical model and its implementation increases the flexibility of business processes management, as revealed by several academic and industrial S-BPM projects.

+ the structuring of processes models as interacting entities facilitates coordinating business process management activities.
+ A precise and complete definition of the semantics of all S-BPM modeling elements can be found in the attachment of (Fleischmann et al. 2012a). 
+ All services are triggered in a synchronous way, i.e. a subject only reaches its subsequent state once all services called in a certain state have been completed.
+ As already shown subjects can execute three different types of actions: Sending messages to other subjects, 
receiving messages from other subjects, and performing local actions on business objects.

+ The creation of a process instance is not only caused by humans. It can also be caused by certain data states, a timer or by instances of other processes belonging to the same process network.
