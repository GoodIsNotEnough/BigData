认真读懂来龙去脉,相信自己可以坑下去，需要付上足够的时间代价

任何时候投文章前，一定先打印出来从头到尾看一遍！！！

找代码实现的方法
1. 读论文，论文中一般会公布实现的代码；
2. 用google在github上直接搜索，比如搜索关键词：github GBRBM 或者guthub S-BPM

金句欣赏：
This separation of logical model and its implementation increases the flexibility of business processes management, as revealed by several academic and industrial S-BPM projects.

the structuring of processes models as interacting entities facilitates coordinating business process management activities.

A precise and complete definition of the semantics of all S-BPM modeling elements can be found in the attachment of (Fleischmann et al. 2012a). 

All services are triggered in a synchronous way, i.e. a subject only reaches its subsequent state once all services called in a certain state have been completed.

As already shown subjects can execute three different types of actions: Sending messages to other subjects, 
receiving messages from other subjects, and performing local actions on business objects.

The creation of a process instance is not only caused by humans. It can also be caused by certain data states, a timer or by instances of other processes belonging to the same process network.
